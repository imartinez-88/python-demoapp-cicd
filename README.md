# Python Flask CI/CD Pipeline (Docker + AWS EC2)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** that takes a Python Flask application from source code to a **live, publicly accessible cloud deployment** using:

- GitLab CI/CD
- Docker images
- AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
- SSH-based deployment
- Environment variables and secrets

The goal is to understand **end-to-end deployment flow**, not just application code.
